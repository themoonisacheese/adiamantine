# adiamantine
a python script to optimize "Incan gold" / "Diamant" play.
# Usage
run with python3 adiamantine.py

each turn, input the number of players who ran away and the card that was pulled out.

enter the total point amount for gem cards, "h1"-"h5" for each type of hazard and "a" for artifact

the script automatically removes appropriate cards from play from the current round and the whole 5-round game if necessary.

this was developped to test github copilot, as is probably evident by the inane comments

copilot is so good it's scary.
